# ESP32 WinKeyer

A WinKeyer-compatible CW keyer on an ESP32, reachable over WiFi. Iambic
paddle keying with local element generation, a K1EL-compatible host
protocol so logging software talks to it as a WinKeyer, and an optional
FlexRadio backend that keys a 6000/8000-series radio over the network.

WinKeyer protocol by Steve K1EL. K3ng CW keyer by Anthony Good K3NG used
as a behavioural reference; the implementation here is original.

## Status

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Keyer core — iambic A/B, sidetone, PTT, pot, break-in | working, bench-verified |
| WinKeyer protocol engine (WK 2.3 host mode) | working, verified with `tools/wk-test.py` |
| WiFi TCP transport + mDNS `winkeyer.local` | implemented, needs WiFi onboarding to verify |
| FlexRadio backend (discovery + `cwx`) | implemented, needs a radio to verify |
| Host bridge (`tools/wk-bridge.py`) | implemented, needs the TCP path up |

Display and Bluetooth keyboard are considered but not built — see
`HANDOVER.md`.

## Quick start

```bash
python3 install.py     # bootstraps PlatformIO (macOS/Pi aware), verifies the build
./flash.sh             # build + upload (picks the serial port)
./monitor.sh           # serial monitor
```

1. First boot opens WiFi AP **`vu2cpl-esp32-winkeyer-setup`** (password
   `vu2cpl1234`). Join it, pick your network. Creds persist in NVS. The
   keyer works with no WiFi — onboarding is non-blocking by design.
2. Copy `include/secrets.h.example` → `include/secrets.h` and set the MQTT
   role password. `secrets.h` is git-ignored.

## Wiring

| Signal | GPIO | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Paddle dit (tip) | 25 | internal pullup, paddle closes to GND |
| Paddle dah (ring) | 26 | internal pullup, paddle closes to GND |
| Key out | 33 | active high → PC817 opto (330 Ω) or NPN → rig KEY |
| PTT out | 32 | active high → PC817 opto (330 Ω) or NPN → rig PTT |
| Sidetone | 4 | passive piezo to GND |
| Speed pot | 34 | ADC1, 10 k pot across 3V3–GND; **enable with `/pot on`** |
| Status LED | 2 | onboard |

Paddles need no external parts. The pot is disabled in firmware until you
wire one, because GPIO 34 floats. See `include/pins.h`.

## Connecting logging software

The keyer speaks the WinKeyer protocol over a TCP socket. Loggers want a
serial port, so run the bridge:

```bash
./tools/wk-bridge.py
```

That creates `/tmp/winkeyer` (a symlink to a PTY) and shuttles bytes to
`winkeyer.local:8088`. Point the logger at that path and choose WinKeyer
as the keyer type. Verified hosts: anything speaking WK2 — N1MM+, DXLog,
RUMlogNG, MacLoggerDX, SkookumLogger, fldigi.

For **N1MM+ in a VM**, map the VM's COM port to the host TCP socket with
the VM's serial-over-TCP option instead of using the bridge.

Network latency does not affect CW: every element is timed on the keyer
(or on the radio, in Flex mode). The socket only carries text and status.

Wired fallback: the USB serial port is a text CLI at 115200 that switches
itself into the WinKeyer binary protocol as soon as a host-open command
arrives, and back to the CLI on host close.

## FlexRadio

```
/flex on            # enable, then it finds the radio by discovery
/flex ip 192.168.1.77   # or pin the address
/backend flex       # route buffered text to the radio
```

In Flex mode, buffered text goes to the radio with `cwx send` and the
**radio** generates the CW, so network jitter never reaches the air. The
local key output is disabled to avoid keying the rig twice; sidetone stays
on locally. The slice must be in CW mode.

Paddle keying deliberately stays on the local key output — real-time
element timing over WiFi would carry the jitter. For a Flex in the same
shack, wire the key output to the radio's KEY jack and use the network for
buffered text.

## Tools

```bash
./tools/wk-test.py --serial /dev/cu.usbserial-0001   # exercise the protocol
./tools/wk-test.py --host winkeyer.local             # ...over WiFi
./tools/wk-bridge.py                                 # TCP → serial port
```

## Serial CLI

`/wpm N` `/mode a|b` `/swap` `/tune` `/pot on|off` `/ptt on|off`
`/st N|on|off` `/backend local|flex` `/flex on|off|ip <addr>|auto`
`/net` `/status`. Any other line is sent as CW.

## MQTT

- Broker: `192.168.1.10:1883` (auth required — role account in `secrets.h`).
- Status: `shack/esp32-winkeyer/status` (retained; LWT `{"event":"offline"}`),
  heartbeat carries WPM, busy, backend, host/TCP/Flex connection state.
